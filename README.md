##### I started creating computers and software back in 1988, when my schools library aquired their first Apple computer. A few short years later I taught myself to program BASIC and C. During middle school I built several Apple hackintoshes for use by our school -- made with old AT&T PC7300's and Atari 800's. After finishing high school and taking advanced mathematics courses at `Dartmouth`, I attending `Rennselaer Polytechnical Insititute` for `Electrical Engineering` in 2000. After one very long semester I left the college to pursue my passion for `Internet Graphics`, `Games`, and `Electronic Music`. Around 2006 the college I attended invited my startup company `American Ad Trader` to work and teach in the RPI Incubator with graduate students and Ph.d.'s. During this time, I began researching scalable VOIP networks for `Bluestone Telecommunication` and wrote my dissertation called `Open 3D Bible` for `Google`. At this time I realized the neccessity for open source, so I began helping out on the google code project. 

##### After working on 7nm chip debugging software for `Global Founderies`, I founded `Bat Country Entertainment` with my best friend.  Our company helped create and develop the modular system and community for `Minecraft`. We also released our first `Xbox360` game `Aardbloxx` in ~2012, and iOS game `Dicecapades`. In my spare time I was volenteering code and servers for the `Einstein@Home` project -- astrophysic supercomputer for LIGOS which was attempting to map our universe to prove the existence of blackholes with recursive signal processing of pulsar data. My work in this inspired me to model Mars and our solar system, to accurate scale from MGS satellite data, for a simulation game about ancient aliens and the roots of humanity. 

##### In 2017 I help start a public benefit corporation called `DreamScale` which was working on open sourcing artifical intelligence machine learning and emotional intelligent supply chains for technological development. In 2018 I created a linux kernel and xwindow called `Torchie` and developed a new programming language called `Dragon` which was accepted to the github Artic Vault.

##### I have a heavy concentration in 3D Rendering, AI, Game Theory, Quantum Fields, and Innvotaion. My other passions include writing, designing, and creating `Stories`, `Scripts`, and `Mechanics` for Video Games, Movies, Applications, and Virtual Realty. In my personal time I love hiking, snowboarding, and composing music.
